description: I wanted a quick way to add micro blog posts to this site, so I added a test!
micro: true

Given that this is a test I don't want to write too much because well, this is a micro post test! Still I'll have something to say about this. 

#### So why do I want micro posts?

Sometimes I have something on my mind and I like the format of my own site, therefore I want to write it here. It also forces me to only write 200 words so you can read it in two minutes. That sounds about right!
