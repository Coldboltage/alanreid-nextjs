Ever since going to Croatia, one of the things that Northern Ireland really need to import is Somersby. I have no clue why it's not sold here but it would probably take the cider business by stome.

### So what's the craic?

As you've seen, I've been a lot more active on here! It was on a whim but I laid it all out in (this blog post)[/2026-times-flies]. There's some small things I'll like to add on the blog.

- Update the Projects

I've got both Productsbolt and Jobsbolt to add. One of the reasons I haven't added it yet is because there's no frontend. I keep thinking I'll just vibe code the frontend, but I think that's a terrible idea. Outsourcing the work in that capacity while in the pursuit of wanting to get better, feels like wanting to cook better Thai food, but then buying a takeout instead. Sure you get the same food, but you never get better at the thing of interest. That's another conversation which I'll pen. I'll figure a way to add it in a way which makes sense.

- Mobile UI

The navbar needs a bit of work. I don't aim to make a burger menu style interaction. I'll probably just make the text smaller, decrease the gap and from there.

I'm fairly happy with the site, though I will be thinking of ways to make it better and better! I won't be rushing to get that sorted.

### Productsbolt

There's been a lot of posts here about the updates of Productsbolt. As said, this is a personal project which isn't intended for public consumption, but it's essentially a put a product in a magic box and you'll be given the best place to buy the product in stock. There was some optimisations I had to work on which I think most of them have now been applied, though I can still think of two in my head as of right now. The big thing was making it usable without thinking it'll break for no good reason (well the link updater might still need work), and it's more about getting it on a machine which I'll be happy with. I'll look to see what is the most optimal system right now which is cheap as I'd rather have a server now. Then again my wee laptops might be perfectly fine but I need to look this up more.

### Jobsbolt

I haven't worked on this at all and to be honest, this would have been the easier of the two projects to work on. It has everything pretty much setup other than it being a great product. I think I'll work on this challenge pretty soon. It's interesting to me. I think there's merit on having a system look up jobs constantly and rating it. I didn't use a reasoning model so this could be really cool to employ something intelligent on it. The issue is cost. I want this to be very cheap and using a paid model just doesn't sit right with me but then again, I can test it pretty easily as long as I keep the openai SDK being used. Learnings from Productsbolt will help with setup.

### Being more scripty again

One thing I really should be doing is utilising normal JS in normal day life. That's silly to say but I take it like languages. I should be a lot more ready to go onto VSC, make something for a page to do something just on the whim. That seems pretty fun. I remember when making Skyscanner Plus (I mean Explorer Plus huehue), I needed all the airports and cities with the 3 letter code thing. I went onto Wikipedia and made bot to grab the information and then saved it as a JSON. As I'm to pen soon, I can just copy the page and paste it into GPT, which will do it for me. While this again sorts the issue out, it doesn't help with the push to being better. I think it's a good idea to just go out of my way and learn this sort of stuff again. Reminds me of learning a language.

### What I aim to do now?

Well the aim to get back into the workforce is up there and I know cloud technologies is the thing that's slowing me down. I did work with AWS CDK there for a bit and I have a fairly good idea what the craic is there. I think I'm more interested to just get immersed with coding all over again as I'm doing right now, but to get back into the frontend challenge.

I'll probably work more on Productsbolt this week and get it properly locked down. Right after this, I'll look up what is the most optimial system to make and we'll see what to do from there. Big issue is RAM and computer systems are getting more expensive, but then again I have this PC I'm using, though I don't game as much or at all, anymore.

As said in the last few posts, I keep thinking what needs done. There's not much that needs done so I'll write on a notepad the annoying things of Productsbolt and fix it.

### Me, how am I doing?

I think I'm doing grand. Really enjoying my anime binge this year. I think I want to make something that's public that shows the anime that one has been watching this year in a way which is very easy to navigate. That's going to demand frontend skills again. Boo. I'm interested in using the MyAnimeList API and see what's in offer there. They update pretty regularly so something that checks the name of the anime really easily, the date and then there you go. It's what you watched that day. It's really for me because boi I hate forgetting what I watched and when, so I'll do something with this.

Want to get the car stuff sorted also. Aim to travel around the country with just a laptop and allow the bots to do their thing! I need the GPU and my laptop has a RTX 3080 so it would be able to do both the Productsbolt and Jobbolt workloads. So I could travel with the tentbox and just enjoy life, which is something I think I'm going to look more into today and this week. Most of my friends will probably think I'm a nutcase, but with this sort of idea, programming is a good thing to look more and more into. I should probably add a category on this website called opinion. Aye I'll do that.

I'm doing solid. I guess I just gotta push myself from the comfort and just go for it.
