Today I decided to start properly managing my own projects with GitHub Issues: Project Manager (which I'll refer to as GitHub or GitHub Issues). I've used Trello and JIRA but I hadn't used GitHub Issues so here we are. 

### Is it any good?

Given I've just started using it, it's taken a wee bit of time to get used to it but yes, it's fairly solid. I'm able to build a table which gives me the base down "admin" approach. This is fairly solid for setting up the project and maintaining it. GitHub Issues comes with the normal board which most Agile like platforms are very much comfortable with. 

#### How am I using GitHub Issues?

For now, I'm using it in a very basic capacity. I took the "feature" template which works fairly well for the board view. I didn't like the tables it had preset because of how small this website is, myself. I therefore did the following. 

* I created three sections for features, bugs and content. 
* To make sure to manage the features, each feature issue will nest sub issues.
* A new section is created for that feature "Feature:{name}" so to know which feature the seperate issues refer to.
* In the future, SEO and Marketing will be added.

#### What more do I need to learn?

I'd like to learn more about GitHub Issue's workflows. I haven't really worked with them yet but the point of setting up GitHub Issues was to get more experience with Agile formats. Applying it now seems to be a good idea and I learning about it's workflows looks to be a good long term idea. 

[Github Issues: Project Manager](https://github.com/features/issues) is worth giving a try.
