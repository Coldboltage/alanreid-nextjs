Firstly I fixed my blog which is awesome. It needed done, at last, it's back and working the way I want it. It wasn't even that hard to sort but beforehand, I lacked the self confidence to think I could sort it out. I'm using Git for goodness sake I can break stuff and fix it afterwards. Sometimes I'm not that smart.

### A reset was needed

I didn't think it but it seemed to be the case that I was very runned down. At the time, I didn't realise it but as the holiday went on, I felt a lot better. A lot more relaxed. Was it all the sun? Being with fun, good people? Was it the food, the anime binge. It's probably the combination of all of these things. It's great to be among fantastic people and while I would love to keep traveling but reality kicks in. Not the reality that we have to get back to work but really a self reflection of myself.

### Some form of competition

I do enjoy competition in some capacity. I don't know how I'm going to get that. I usually got that from gaming but I kind of want to somehow tie my competition with programming. Therefore I've decided to somehow use coding for more than just building things but for the competitive side of it. I'm not sure how I'm going to do that but right now, I'm going to try to start it off with using Codewars again. It feels like a good idea. 

### Codewars

Talking about codewars, I'm starting to play on codewars again as it's a good way to figure out code which I at least know, look at code which other people have used and try to figure out why they've used it. It's been fantastic now with ChatGPT because I can ask it what or how the other code works. I be honest, it's hard to just sit down and get the code done but I should try to at least put in an hour everyday. Right now, if I don't understand the queston, I skip it and I'm only doing very simple level 7 problems. A lot of the times, it's hard to figure out how to sort out the problem. While sorting out the problem is good, I need to figure out some plan where if I really am stuck, I try to get hints so then I can figure it out. Maybe I'll use ChatGPT for that. Maybe a three hint situation and then afterwards.

### I'll be writing a lot more again

I have a lot more to which I can talk about and I didn't even talk about my holiday much here. Really I just wanted to say that it was the fact i went on holiday, that gave me the push to start aiming higher again and wihle I've always tried to hit higher, the holiday helped to kick start it again. Let's see what the craic is in the future!
