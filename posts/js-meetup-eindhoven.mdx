One year ago, I was probably making this website. I should probably look at the first time there was a commit on this site. I remember seeing the design of my previous site and thought, that's just not goot enough. I therefore made this website in an attempt to showcase myself. I think it was maybe March or April when I thought to work on MidFactor, something that I'd like to work on again for the laugh but for now, effort is in Explorer Plus to work on getting that it to TypeORM and also to refactor terrible parts of the site. Who knows, maybe I'll look to use Playwright. It seems to be the rage now. 

### So what's the craic

I'm not too sure what to think. I decided to come to Eindhoven because well I can be. One of the dreams of being a developer was to travel and meet new people, talk to people, go to new places, see what the world has to offer. As a developer, that chance is here and I'm living it now. I do want to buy a house in the future, but I need to live and be excited about life, so why not travel. 

### JS Belfast and London. Now Eindhoven

I thought why the hell not. I've met a lot of people in Belfast because of JS and the same is for Dublin. This will be the 3rd JS event which I've went to and I think it'll be a cool thing like with LANs, to start getting all the badges to showcase all the meetups I've went to. Given that we're JS developers, it's probably a really good idea to go to events like this to meet up with people. Is there anything I'm interested to listen to about to, I have absolutely no idea of what the speakers will be talking about today while I have no idea if they'll even speak English. That'll be a laugh if they don't. 

### The main reason why I'm here!

Per like the esports days, it's important to meet your team and to get to properly know them. While Discord is something, it's not enough and so meeting the team to have a laugh and experience something, big or small, I think is mega important. 

### On my way home

Wasn't expecting to add to this post but here I am! On my way home and as per always, I'm apprehensive to do new things though wanting to do new things. On reflection, my travels here and meeting the dev team, I can certainly say I'm working with some really good people who also are fantastic developers. While the business world pushes a narrative that your work life and normal life should be seperate, I see it a bit different. When you can meet your colleagues at the personal level, to have a drink, to eat pizza and to go to the cinema to watch a scary movie, that is when you start to really trust in your team. In esports, as much as one could game online and meet people, it wasn't the same until you met someone. It's probably why I'm so fond of my 2013 days, meeting the IPG guys. 

That being said, I heavily enjoyed my 2020 days with Viperio also. I think I did a great job getting the team to bound together and go for a dream. Here at Shockbyte, I feel more connected to the job. I understand Orbit a lot better, I feel a need to get studying and working and while I might be putting time to this blog post, just being involved in the development level of anything, is a great idea.
