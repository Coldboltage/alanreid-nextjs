Yesterday, I was fairly convinced on the path that I wanted to go on. I was going to give it a shot with frontend and take up on more oppurtunities which would be made available. I've noticed when looking for work, frontend react is what people are looking for and it's probably the fastest way to get work. It was clear to me. Get more understood on design systems and a better idea of what it is to be a frontend developer and transistion to backend development. 

Today, I had a call with a recruiter. Jon played the middle man when helping companies who don't have proper recruitment systems in place. It was clear to him that I was not going to be the frontend developer he wanted. I had an arm with him to ask a few questions and while I didn't come to the conclusion in that conversation, it certainly helped me come to my new one. 

It's very easy to write and write on the keyboard. Sometimes we write so quickly, we're not too sure what we've wrote. It's why I go to the pen and paper when jotting out thoughts. Given how I've stopped writting as I would think, the majority of the world, writing fast on the paper looks like a mess. You are forced to slow down, to write correctly. Even if you want to write quickly, it's not as fast as what you can do on a keyboard. Personally, I don't write that quickly compared to many type racers. To the point you murmer, I shall move on. 

I got downstairs, found my pokka dot jotter and a pen and starter writing. Wrote the date per usual, Thursday 25th August 2022 (Happy Birthday Warren), and got to writing. Usually I can write for a very long time, drawing out my thoughts but I think I had already come to some sort of conclusion but wanted to get it in paper in some capacity. 

While frontend would help me get to a job a lot quicker than pushing on with the backend of work, it occured to me that if I went down this path, then my choice to go into development would have been a wasted endeavour. I moved from SEO so that I could make things. Yes initially it was to make websites a lot quicker, to rank the highest for websites out there. Gatsby certainly did this well and it's been fantastic. What I don't need to know is design systems, how to make something look incredible. How to make great UI systems or the perfect looking button. These are things that used to matter. Now they don't anymore. 

What I want to do, is make things for people and I. That's not even really true to be honest. I want to make things that I think is cool and help make things for others when I think they need a hand. Take this. I build a Web API so to grab posts from a WordPress site which had terrible elementor HTML markup and cleaned it. This allowed Phil to create all his posts that he needed for the project he needed, without having to do it himself. Ultimately I could have made this into an API that others could have used and I probably should have pushed on with that. 

I can't make a betting bot via making it look pretty. I can't make sure that it runs perfectly without good testing. I know that if I want to create things, being a better backend developer is going to be far more interesting and while the lure of having a job far faster is a lot more interesting, this is not the type of thing that I needed to have done. If I wanted to get a job asap and wanted to just be in development for the money, I would just stayed as an SEO and got paid well and master that craft. I didn't because it wasn't what I wanted. The money wasn't worth it. 

Money is great, do not get me wrong. It's what makes the world run and it opens doors. Legacy matters a little bit more to me. I want to build things that are actually useful for people but ultimately, useful for me. If I see something that I can make because it interests me and is worth my time, I want to be able to make that. I want to have just enough design skills that allows for the UI to be cool looking but in the same time, I might just employ someone to do that. "Make it look pretty". Maybe that arrogant. I don't think it is though. You can be a great SEO and you can be a great frontend developer. You certainly need them to build a great business. Ideas though, that's what I have. I have ideas which I need to act on and I can't really do that as a frontend developer and so as a result, the jobs that are available now as a react developer, well they can go fuck. 

I am going to be a great backend developer which has the ability to make things when I feel like it. Can I make a social media website? I'm not too sure where to start with that but I know other people have thought about it and could outline what exactly is needed and then I go from there. 

What I do know is when I want to make something that interests me, I want to have the skills to be able to make the hard parts of it. That's building out the idea to an MVP position. I say MVP and think Meteor but not, I'll be sticking with the MERN stack. I like it. I think it gets me to where I think I need. So yea, that's the direction. I'm going to be a fantastic backend developer that makes things. 

Now it's time to find the right resources to get me to that place.
