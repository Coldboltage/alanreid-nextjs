description: It's crazy how fast two months go. I'm surprised it's already been this long at Shockbyte
---

I've been working with Shockbyte for 'two' months and it's some of the fastest, greatest and nervous times. In my last post, I didn't talk much about what I did in Shockbyte but rather the process of getting the job. As I've worked with Shockbyte for two months, I wish to talk about this now, however long or short.

### Coming into Shockbyte

Working on your own projects, helping friends and working as a short term contractor in a company is very different than working 40+ hour weeks at Shockbyte. When coming in, after passing the test, I thought I'd be coming into something that I would be fairly understood with. It was like getting a hammer to the face the shock I had of the scale of the job. I thought Skyscanner Plus was big but as soon as I understood the scale of Shockbyte, Skyscanner Plus is a very small, manageable app to work on. As I said to my friends and family after the first week with Shockbyte, 'you'll never be prepared enough, and you just have to jump into it.

I had only learnt how to use Nest and to be fair, I'm still learning how to use Nest. It's a great framework, one which has so many featuress which I will use in future projects. The scale of the complexity of use which we use here at Shockbyte, is mindboggling. Then looking at Vue and going 'this is some funny looking syntax.'

One can never be prepared to join something like Shockbyte in the position I was in. That's ok. The skills which I've developed is in the knowing of what to learn, the issues I have and correcting them. As Scott Galloway said, the only way to get better, is to spar against people that are far better than you (Video)[https://youtu.be/1T22QxTkPoM?t=77]. As a competitor, I know about this but as a programmer in a workplace, the drive to have to do better is fantastic. 

### That's some filler Alan but what's the craic?

A lot of learning and grwoth. I know that I want to remake Skyscanner Plus "to be renamed" with NestJS. Generally being better with Nest is the thing I want to develop. Given the constraints I've put myself with Skyscanner Plus and now the confirmation they aren't interested to work with myself, Skyscanner has an API I'm going to directly access and use for private purposes. Friends and family will have access to thsi in the future and hopefully I'll have something ready by the beginning of January. I really want this to be ready by then and I make need to take time out of my week to get this sorted sometime int he future. Maybe Christmas Week. 

In relation to work, I like using Nest and I want to get better with it. Vue on the other hand, I thought was a lot harder than it needed to be but it's not actually that bad. It's probably just my inability to understand web design and so working on this site will be awesome. So we'll see more updates on this website in the future. 

One thing I really should be better at is making functions and components more reusable. This will be something I work on. The bigger thing that I want to work on is logic puzzles. I've noticed that I'm not as sharp as I once was and I want to put in a couple of hours a day in them so I can figure out better ways to get over problems and create solutions. I'll start from really simple to really hard again and go from there. 

### I don't really have much more to syntax

It's been a blur the last two weeks. The emotions of success and stress I remember very well. The major lesson I learnt with this job isn't that one can code well. That is one part of it. The big part is writing and figuring out ways to come to a solution to a problem and to figure it out. That can only come with practise and so I want to practie and practise and slowly get better rather than just jumping to hard questions. I'll be using Codewars quite a bit and I might find a way to connect it to this website. I think I should expose for who I am on this website and so, it is in my best interest to keep myself crediable to myself. 

Programming everyday is certainly going to be the answer but I need to make sure I still have a life. This is important and so Skyscanner Plus is going to be that answer. I want to travel the world, work and get smarter and have the motivation to become something amazing. I'll find a way to integrate Codewars to this site in the future.
