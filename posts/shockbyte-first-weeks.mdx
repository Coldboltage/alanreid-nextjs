I'm going to talk about how I got here, if you're not interested in that, follow the headings and you'll find where I talk about Shockbyte

###

One of my dreams was to get onto the LEC stage as a manager and to be there for my players. Unfortunately I never made it to true professional gaming. I'm very happy that many of the players I did work with, achieved that. My second dream, which I can easily remember back at 2011, was to program. I remember looking at Codecademy thinking, this is the thing for me. I remember also seeing Riot brought out their bug bounty program thinking, this is something I wanted to get involved with. 

The plan was that I could do both. Be a developer and a hobbiest manager but this never came to be. Managing players takes a lot of time or at least, I put a lot of time into it. This time last year though, the fun stopped and I decided it was time to do something new. I decided to go full into programming. 

At this point, I knew my frontend alright. I was probably working on roster.lol "RIP, cba with lol" and it was a good project to understand GraphCMS and figure out what I had to do to get better. I learnt there was way too much manual work going on but I didn't really have an answer to that other than automation of some kind. 

### Thank goodness for Puppeteer

Now I can't remember exactly what came first. Was it web scrapping or what is Puppeteer. I can't remember but I do remember while watching guides, NodeJS kept coming up. This was because Next uses Node and I was not understand Brad and his tutorials very well, so I decided I had to learn Node. All I remember was, as soon as I looked into Puppeter, I knew this was something I wanted to get involved with. Now that I think about it, it was Puppeteer that I found first, because I remember working with Mongo and Mongoose and having a fair idea of it quickly. Then I did the Node course thinking "I've done this before" and was able to refer to the guides on the bot course. I'm not too sure why I went into Puppeteer. I think it was purely luck or I had some sort of interest to web scrapping. I can't exactly remember but thankfully, it leveraged upon Node which gave me a way to get into Node. 

From there, I went to learn Node which then led to learning Express and with the limited understanding of Mongo, I had enough to start building things. I could see progress being made. 

### Then Shockbyte came along

I was taking care of my mates house, Soc. He needed someone to make sure that his house was safe and to make sure his step son wouldn't be an idiot. Who you hang around with, determines who you might become. I got a message from Shockbyte that they wanted an interview so I agreed and I had a screen with Scott. To this point, I still couldn't remember who Shockbyte were and I don't recall applying to them, but fate be it, I had the chat with Scott and it must have went well, because I was talking to Damien, my line manager, supervisor and brilliant source of help. 

With making Skyscanner Plus, I had a really good idea of how to do the technical test, however it was to be in Nest and that was the issue. I had never used Nest and my typescript understanding was limiting. So I decided to prove to myself that I could do the task, I did it in Node/Express and I got the task technically completed. At this point, the challenge was to learn Nest and then to do the same thing. After reading the test and looking at the things that Nest helps with, the structure of the interview was to test if I could learn and use Nest. I had seen that I wanted to use Nest previously and seen it to be a good way to enter Typescript and with Express being... expressive, I didn't like the lack of structure. Sure we know MVP but looking at a lot of opensource, there's many ways to go about this. Nest forces a form of convention and I seen good reason to it. 

### The test was rather, can I learn fast enough?

This test that Shockbyte had given me, at the techincal level, I understood and already completed but it wasn't in Nest but I could see why it was needed. While this was a test to prove if I could work for Shockbyte, this was more about if my systems of learning and grasping things, were going to work. I unfortunately don't learn well initially from reading documentation and need guides to help with getting used to something. The process is something like this,

* Find a crash course. Grasp the most important information that I need to understand right at the start.
* Get a Udemy course which allows for comprehensive understanding of the subject. The course course helps with understanding some concepts from the get go. 
* Where the Udemy course only glazes through, use a Youtube video to go into more depth or another Udemy course. 
* If I can understand just a little bit of the subject, read the documentation to grasp a far better understanding and start crawling "SEO TERM" through the documentation, using information I grasp to connect the dots. 

In the case of the coding interview, as I understood a lot of the concepts from Express and the MVC model, a crash course helped to get understanding what Nest was doing differently. Then a course was used to get into Nest. The crash course helps cement understanding of what the main course gives. Then I used a couple of youtube guides to understand deeper concepts which wasn't used in the guide which is fine, getting the fundamental understanding and then knowing what else needs learnt, is the key thing here. Afterwards, documentation starts to make more sense and as soon as you understand one point, you can start grasping other parts given information you grasped beforehand. 

I believe this process is my way to getting to learn something from the core concepts, to the most important things a course wants to give, to then expanding where I need to and then being able to get into the documentation, the meat of it. It gets me learning something which is all I really want from it, and it's what I'm using right now, to learn Vue. 

### The news

So on the 6th of October 2022, I was offered a job with Shockbyte. While my dreams of being a manager on the professional stage never happened, I can hold my head up high and say, I did everything for my players and players from years ago that made it, retired and new players which are trying to aspire to become the best, speak to me to ask for advice. I will always help players/staff I've worked with. It's a promise I give each one of them. You can rely on me. 

It has been a hell of a road to get here. It's very possible that if I had never tried with esports, I would have been here years ago. But I don't think I'd have nearly one quarter of the stories that esports gave me. It's even possible that I would have given up with the programming and regret never trying with esports, because at that point, at 2013, if you missed it, you had a really hard time getting in and luck helped me get into the positions I was in. Trust me on that. 

### So what now? 

Funny enough, I haven't really talked much about Shockbyte and I'll leave that for another day. To be short, it has been a fantastic place. My manager, Damien, has been extremely patient with me and has helped me where needed. Pair programming and reviewing code and being straight to me. I don't need sugar coating. I need honesty and he has been great. The team at Shockbyte have also been fantastic and it's a place I'm happy to be in. I hope my position as a contractor changes soon so that I can have some more security as an employee. It's something I really want and will be talking to Shockbyte about but for the most part, I will be taking this chance, I will be making this my own and I will keep growing. 

I may not become the best progrmamer out there but I don't need to be per like esports. I just need to be really good at my job and I have a long way to make sure I'm at the level my peers are at. 

I have a lot to write about in the future and maybe tonight, when I'm at my own house again, I will write about more things. I'm currently at my fathers house taking care of him. He's not doing the best but I'm here to help him out but the story is a lot different now. This time last year, as the fun stopped, I had to make a choice. SEO or programming and I chose well. Nothing in life is easy to get. What esports taught me, was you gotta could pushing. While it doesn't work all the time, it's about seeing what you've done and being happy about it. 

I'm very thankful for the oppurtunity Shockbyte have given me and there's no way in hell I will let this go. It's too important.
