description: I tried to blog on hashnode, Medium and Dev and I just thought, why not blog on my own blog, so that's what I'm going to do!

I really am a terrible person when it comes to this blog. I put a lot of work into making it thinking I'm going to post in it at least once a week and here it is, still with lorem content in it. That shall end. I have ideas which I want to utilise and my blog shall help me out with it!

### What's been going on?

One of the best things I did for myself was taking that Node course by ZTM. Before that, I took a course about Web scrapping which got me very interested in bots and Node in general. It's helped me a lot. Here's a couple of things I've worked on and done since my last post.

* I've built the betting bot.
* Took a proper Node Udemy Course.
* MVP for SkyscannerPlus
* Took an advance Javascript Course.
* Started mass applying for roles. 
* Went on holiday to Croatia.
* Pushing out of my comfort zone.

I'm not going to talk about everything that I've bullet pointed here but hopefully enough so I can look upon this in the future. It's nice looking back at this sort of thing. 

#### Betting bot
I did build the betting bot but unfortunately the odds and predictions were never good enough to beat 51%. Data between Midnite and the betting predictor wasn't always identical meaning there was a lot of potential bets not placed. Without assured normancy, it became a chore to work on and therefore I have taken it down for now, to work on in the future.


#### SkyscannerPlus MVP
My biggest project to date, I personally am attached to it. Without, I wouldn't have been able to go on holiday for as cheap as I did which is awesome. I learnt how to build a proper MVC API, utilise on Puppeteer effectively, MongoDB management, decouple my API from my Puppeteer backend and create a frontend built upon data which could be pulled from my API. 

There's a lot to still do with this project but I do believe it can help a lot of other people. I will add a projects tab and post micro updates about ths project without it being full updates. I'll reserve big updates to posts like this. 

#### I went on holiday
One of the better decisions I've made from 2018 was go on holiday by myself. I went to Croatia after my friend, Marta, kept telling me to go there, so I did. It was a fantastic holiday where I took a lot of photos and had a lot of beach and relaxing time. Marta was able to come also which was absolutely lovely because I'm very terrible with figuring out what I want to do. That could be due to factors which I'm too embarrassed to talk about here. 

The holiday helped me evaluate about my life, what I want to do with my life, what I want to to and how I should conduct myself. The holiday has certainly been for the best but a month on, I yearn to go back on holiday but that'll have to wait until the Winter festival. 


#### The journey to become a full-time developer
I'm not in a confident position that I can be a solid developer for a company. This time last year, I'd be only interested in frontend development because of the relationship frontend development and SEO developers have. Initial User Experience is something that frontend developers can work on very well. What I've grown to learn though with backend development, is it's ability to bring back users over and over again because of the things you can actually build for the long-term.

I've started to apply for roles as either a frontend, backend or fullstack developer. I'm confident in my ability to do all these roles. What's been brilliant about this time is seeing the skills that I do apply to while seeing what skills I should be aiming to learn. As a result, I'm now learning more about AWS and Docker. These are things I'm certainly going to want to know anyway so I'm happy to push this. 

### Last words
I'll be using Github Issues to start managing this website to keep me on track. I won't be making posts this long and it'll be rare for me to post in this capacity in the future. I want to add a micro blogging mechanism to this blog to force me to keep it under 500 characters. I aim to at least post once a week to this website. We'll see what the craic is!
