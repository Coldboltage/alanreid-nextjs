A small update for the website seeing as I want to always keep myself on the ball with the site. If you see a post with a sunset as the post image, it's probably an update.

#### What's happened this week?

I decided to start using a project manager to get better understood with website project management. I use this website as the test bed for anything I'm further learning to use. A project manager was a good thing to use because it allows me to figure out what I want to post on this site "hi", and it allows me to start figuring out what I need to expand on next. In this case, Typescript. 

#### What do I think of Typescript?

As I'm only developing with it now, I see it as a lot of boiler plate but the more I code with it, the more I'll start to understand the syntax as a natrual thing. Right now, as it takes time for me to understand what I'm looking at, that says I need more time to be exposed to Typescript, which is what I'll do now. 

This whole site will be converted to Typescript so I have a far better understanding of it. I want it to become more natural to me and find more ways to be exposed to it. 

#### The project section was made

Design isn't a strong part for me. In this case, I looked at a design which I liked and from eye, copied it. Since making this website, I haven't used much Tailwind. It's something I need to get more understood with. I created the Project Section and the projectItem component in Javascript but converted it in TS. This was a great idea and so now I'll be converting everything in TS. 

The Project section is live and in the next coming days, I'll add more projects which I feel should be added.

#### What's next?

Getting Typescript fully under my belt is required so I'll be converting this whole site by the end of the week. I was introduced to the creator of Heptagram, an all purpose Discord Bot and I was told some things they'd like for me to work on so this will be my first look into Open Source. I aim to add some testing to the platform.

Talking about testing, that's something else I'll be working on with this site. I'll add some testing to the site to make sure iteractions with the site work. I need to do more CI/CD development so I'll do that!
