Recently I talked about wanting to [add typescript](https://alanreid.dev/project-typescript-update) to add Typescript to this site. The majority of this site has now been converted to Typescript using proper types.

#### What I had done with Typescript?

Previously, I had added Typescript to the site and added some types. What i didn't realise was a big thing was the strict mode. I was in the thinking that I was already working with strict mode. Turns out, I forgot to apply it from false to true. That gave me a wee bit of a wake up call. 

#### What happened after adding use strict mode?

A lot of errors showed up. Things that were warnings before become errors and it needed to be acted upon. My tests weren't able to compelte because the build process wasn't completing. It made me have to work properly with Typescript which I think has helped me in the long term. Think. I'm still getting used to this. I created a types folder to add all the interfaces so I could simply grab the types rather than copying and pasting. This was a far better idea. 

#### Will this help me become a better developer?

After talking to Phil Collins a couple of times, yes I can see the utility of Typescript and it's something that I know I have to get far more more used to. Will it make me into a better developer was the question though and I don't think that's the correct question to ask. Rather, will it make it easier for people to work with me and I believe it will. What this does though is it requires everyone to transistion to Typescript. Therefore I expect more and more content to push the need to learn Typescript and have a seamless transistion from JS. A lot of concepts are learnt from using Typescript. I hope to see more soon.

#### Long time look.

I will be using Typescript for the future. That means for the next components I'm going to be making, it'll be made in Typescript and now JS. As much as I want to use Javascript as it's natural to me, it's time to move away from pure play JS and now embrace TS and get used to it. Like chopsticks, it takes a while to get used to but after getting use to it, you'll never really want to move away from it. Don't get me wrong, I suck with chopsticks but one has to keep trying. The push to attain greatness wasn't made in a day.
