I remember when working with Adrien, he told me about NodeJS. If I wanted a console to use, I could open NodeJS and run code in it without having to worry about loading a web browser. Thinking back now, it be better if he told me how console worked more effectively but he wasn't trying to be a teacher but rather, to help. 

### Working with NodeJS

In my previous post, I was learning how to use Puppeteer. While it was more web scraping that I was looking at, it revolved around using Puppeteer a lot. I haven't got too far in the course and I know I will be working on it more. My issue is my lack of understanding of how to use NodeJS. It always comes back to having to know NodeJS a bit and while these courses help you get through as much as possible without having to know that much NodeJS, because some of the resources are dated, the follow along can sometimes be incorrect. This has led to some problem like not being able to use request-promise on Craigslist. The solution would be to use Puppeteer and it's what I will be doing. What I don't like is the trouble I'm having to load fs and work around Node in general because of these complications and it's why I'm looking at NodeJS.

### Frontend, backend or fullstack/

As I'm aiming to learn more about the backend, I'm effectively aiming to become a fullstack developer, something that I thought would take maybe another year to get to. While I am no where near the frontend developer that I want to be, I have found that even on this website, that knowing more about Node is useful. As far as I'm aware, with NextJS, we do work with the server and that server will be using NodeJS. While getting the frontmatter and the content for the frontpage and generating these pages, I have needed to use Node to build these pages. MDX has been a bit of a pain to get running and with my lack of understanding of NodeJS, I have had to operate with only markdown for now. I aim to change this in the future. 

### Really understanding Javascript

I've always had the understanding that by using NodeJS and learning backend JS, I would have a better understanding of Javascript. In the last two days of learning NodeJS and a wee bit of time learning how to web scrap, I have learnt a lot more about JS and the need to learn more and understand the language that I'm hoping to make my life. I think it's extremely important to learn more about the backend now that I have started so that I can be more creative to what I can build. While frontend literally allows you to showcase what you can do with CSS and it's animations, harnessing both frontend and backend allows me to make solutions which I am still to figure out. I'm excited about the future.
