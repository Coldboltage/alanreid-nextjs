This is going to be a short post as I start to recollect what I want to do next. I remember making this site, I was a lot more frontend geared and looking to this site, I think it'll be a great thing to return and mess around with it. Fix things which I think need to be done and use this place to express myself. I'm still using MDX which I think I'll continue doing.

### So what do I want to do here

I'm just going to talk again. Social media is in a very interesting place where while you might want to express yourself, the platform per like all social medias, restrict what one can do. Tumblr had a good idea where you could edit the profile as much as you could and express yourself, and in an age where AI is getting better and better, one could argue you'll be able to express yourself even better with a personal home page "PHP joke". Point being, social media helps find people who you might be interested with and the same to yourself, but apart from simple conversation and throwing small tipbits, you're given limit tools to express yourself.

I'll make it easy for people to learn who I am on this website. While this website ultimately is about myself as a software developer, what type of software developer comes from the person you are, and I think it's interesting enough to express myself here. I'd like to update this site more effectively to force myself to show progression again, it was always fun doing that and so I'll start messing around here again.

### Productsbolt

Still using the bolt name for things I make. To talk about it quickly, it does the following

- Has a list of many shops and a means to narrow down all pages on a site.
- User adds a product name with context of the product is
- Creates relationship between Shop and Product aka ShopProduct to hold state
- Goes through every shop to find links which are highly ranked versus the productName and context
- Checks the page via LLM to see if the page itself is the product of question (LLM compute logic)
- If product out of stock, track it and if it's available, contact via Discord

While the conception is simple, the interest was making it as optimised as possible and while that challenge is still ongoing, the cost is very minimal and where the cost exists is with sites having a hard time giving a full list of links from the sitemap.

There's lot of logical issues when working on a system like Productsbolt and with more and more time, this could be used for anything to be honest. I'll probably work on this further.

### Jobsbolt

I don't really want to talk about this project too much. A lot of time was put into it and it was ultimately to help get a job. It was very annoying to have to write the cover letter over and over again and find jobs which might actually be suitable. It works fine right now but I did this whenever local LLMs weren't great. Therefore I used the OpenAI Batch API to do a ton of the work. If I were to restart this again, I would use a combination of Local LLM workloads and for more logically driven work, the batch API again.

I believe the project has merit, but it was discouraging not getting through many interviews, and so the project was dropped. I am fairly sure I could restart the project and get it working again. I'm actually happy with what I did.

### I can make things

While writing this, my heart is filled with the happiness that I did build things. I look back on this site and I see that I made Factsbolt. It's obviously outdated now but I probably could make a few changed and make it work better. Productsbolt I could probably make that into a service also. Jobsbolt, something a little more opensource.

### So what's next

As said, I'm using this site to get back into frontend and just to experiment and enjoy what it is to be a developer. To build things. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what to do, but at least with Productsbolt, I really should at least just get a RaspPI or something strong enough for headful use, and just make it run slowly. It doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to work and right now, having Jobsbolt and Productsbolt not running, doesn't really make sense.

I'll figure out more of what I want to do here, but this place is where I'll do my best to express myself. It certainly helps to think in a world where we outsource that a lot of the times now.
