I was in a bar "Hop House" at about 2017 where an acquinatance came up to me to show off some Python he knew on his mobile. At the time, he knew I was working on Rankup.gg as a an SEO Consultant. Somehow the conversation came about to talk about AWS and how it could be used to store our data a lot cheaper than what we were doing it at the time. 

Five years on, I'm now looking to learn more about AWS, how to even approach it and eventually use it. My journey into programming had mastering JS as part of it, but it never occured to me I'd ever have to learn anything to do with AWS. How weird life is.

### So why am I learning it?

Quite frankly, I'm not too sure what AWS does. I know there are many services that it can take care of. I know only of ECS, EC2 and S3 Buckets. There's so many other things that it does, that a journey into AWS is in order. 

The reason why I'm learning about AWS is for two reasons.

- It's a growing requirement to understand AWS and have experience in it. I'll use AWS instead of Heroku as a result
- I'll have to know something to scale Skyscanner Plus in the future. I need a core per search so building machines to then do a search immediately for it to be terminated afterwards if nothing is in queue, would be a solid idea. 

It certainly seems like a skill I'm going to need to know. Knowing AWS should give me the know-how to work with Azure and Google Cloud. Therefore I'm going to look at AWS for the next month and get a strong handle on it. Should be a good laugh.
