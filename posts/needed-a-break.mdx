Since Friday (19th August), I've not coded but on Monday, I just couldn't bring myself to code at all. For some reason, I had a lot of brainfog, a term which I'm hearing more and more these days. I'm going to guess it's a side effect of getting COVID and not feeling good as a result. It's either that or issues with my sleep coming back again. 

Ths matters. I want to be able to code as much as possible and not look like I'm only coding here and there. I want to code whenever I feel like it but in the last couple of days, I just felt so hazy to the point it was easier sitting down. It's not a great feeeling. 

Writing this post now, I still feel slightly tired, a bit dazed is the best way to say it. Ringing in the ears. This can't be a good thing. 

I hope to get programming more and more again. I do enjoy programming but right now, I just can't come to think exactly what I want to push on next. I do know when I feel my full, this isn't much of a problem.
