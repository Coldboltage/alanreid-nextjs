The idea of Productsbolt is pretty simple. Buy something at a cheaper price, sell it higher. Pretty simple. The process of going about that as an application technically is the easier part. While it's taken a few months (could have been far quicker), execution of using Productsbolt is a different question.

### Understanding market conditions

Buy something low, sell high. That is a simple principle but the way I went about it was pretty dumb. Without enough market data to play with, while the product itself was cheap at the time of buying, evidence to suggest if the price would go up was incorrect and this led to some products being over-bought. Essentially more inventory than I would want. Not a good idea.

### Reluctance to continue

This is probably the biggest issue i've had. If I'm to be real, a little bit of hesitance to get things back under control and really an acceptance that I hadn't done things correctly, came a bit late. That said, it's better late than never, and I decided to accept mistakes that I've made and ground myself a bit better.

### How to minimize for the future?

Smaller inventory per product. While it is true that getting the best ROI is most entertaining for me, this isn't going to work for me. There are a couple of things I'll have to look at which I might talk about more in the future, but the reselling of something only works if the price once bought at, will increase or one has bought it at such a cheap price from somewhere, the selling elsewhere can only be advantageous.

### Conclusion

I was fairly stupid how I started utilising on Productsbolt. The application itself works very well and I'm happy about that. The problem was me and it affected the progress of this project. I feel I'm in a better place now. Yes I've made mistakes and there's quite a lot of circumstances that need to be thought of. I guess I'm not the subject expert for this which is problematic and puts me in a position of not knowing, so I'll figure out a systematic/logical setup, which allows for an easier time to know what to buy and when. This might lead to a researcher tool to help come to that point.
