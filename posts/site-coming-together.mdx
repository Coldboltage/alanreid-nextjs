I've had a lot of inspiration when building this site and to be honest, I feel absolutely guility for it. I'll have to change this up in the future but to get started, I've taken huge inspiration for the design on the site. 

## Tailwind is cool

It takes a little bit of time to get used to Tailwind. A lot of the building of this site, has been the learning of Tailwind and how to apply it. It doesn't help that intellisense doesn't come up often but the documentation is fantastic. Without such documentation, I would have sticked with vanilla CSS. There's a couple more things I want to learn from Tailwind such as getting more breakpoints setup so 425px can be accomodated to more effectively and then looking up Flowbite. It'll be well useful to learn that. 

## NextJS in general

I made this website with NextJS. It's a different workflow which is lower level that GatsbyJS, which I enjoyed developing with. I needed to test out another framework. One of the things I enjoy a lot more with NextJS would have to be it's SSG implementation. Gatsby's API routes were very annoying to operate with. With NextJS, after getting used to getStaticPaths, this has become a very easy thing to work with. 

Another big thing is that there's a lot of tutorials and information going about. This is fantastic as I would consider myself, a slower learner. Overall, NextJS has been solid however if this site was purely static, I'd use GatsbyJS as there's performance being left at the table. More developing is needed. 

## What's next?

Here's what I need to add to the this site. 

* Project Page
* Journal Page
* Contact Page
* Most posts
* More information in About Page
* Sort pages based upon time the post was made

I'm glad that I've made this site, it looks a lot better than my Gatsby site. That was near a year ago that I made it. It did it's job but I'm a lot happier with this design. It's better.
