Okay it's been 19 days but it feels like it's been a month! I've put some effort to get back in the groove of constantly coding and to be honest, it's enjoyable but in some sense, conflicting. When I built this website, which I think was 2022, I that's when I really thought of Skyscanner Plus, and I think I coded a lot. Sitting on my sofa from 08:00 to 01:00, just coding away sometimes and getting things made. Tinkering and trying to get things I wanted sorted. It was good to be able to do that and to be honest, I'm probably able to do that again so I'll look into ways to be even more productive with the coding. I'll figure that out.

### So what's conflicting?

I've enjoyed being able to go downstairs at 18:00 and watch my anime sesh. That said, yesterday I did feel like I had burnt myself out on my anime binges and maybe it was time to watch a normal movie, Heartbreak Ridge. Not go be taken too seriously but it was enjoyable to Tom Highway (Clint) do all he could to make sure his men were battle ready. To not die on the battlefield. To be the best person we can be (however conflicting that can sound).

I guess for a few years, it was all I was doing but I have to argue, it made me good at what I was doing. I enjoy being very good at something or having the skill to make things on demand. The conflict comes with the balance of life and myself. After I lost my job at 2024, I tried to balance life a little better. Don't code all the time, don't just be a singular person and try to spread out. It's now 2026 and I have to be honest, I'm not sure if I'm made that way. Looking back, it was either gaming to try to be the very best in the world in vCoD, managing in the many titles I operated with and made sure my players were best equiped as I could to win titles and quite recently, coding/building/developing.

### The logic of life might not apply

It's very possible I'm a very one dimensional person and trying to do many of things and therefore limiting myself the time to actually get very good at something, is problematic and I believe the two years have evidenced that. To be honest I'd love to watch anime all of the time and getting a real mastery of the understanding of the story telling, though let's be honest, most of the stuff is trash so that might be wasted on me. Gaming, honestly I'd love to be way way better but again, I'm not in the sort of position in life anymore that affords me the ability to just game all the time like I was back in 2000s + 2010s. Here's the thing, I like building things and the years coming up to now, I've gotten better. Am I amazing, no. I feel I have so much more to learn and I'm the type of person that things come slow to. I think because of this, I have to accept that putting the extra time and effort, is the way to go and figure a way to make everything else work to it.

### Is it even a good idea with the way the industry is moving

I'm in the belief the skills will always be needed. Knowing how to solve the problem using Claude Code, affords you more time to do more interesting things. Per like trying to setup a vLLM, I'm having to RELY on LLMs to help me set things up. This is not the way to go and I really should have a better understanding of why it's so hard to get vLLM to operate sometimes. However I'm outsourcing that to and LLM and that's not a good idea in the long term. Now if I knew what the problem was or something about it and the outputs were making sense to me, I would be able to be more proactive but I'm being reactive, and I'm one layer in "knowledge debt", where another layer, means I am fully reliant on an LLM. I don't think that's the way it should be.

### So what's the answer

I have the feeling that just going on the grind and doing work constantly is the only way to go about it. It kinda sucks but I mean, it does work and I have the past to showcase that it's mostly true. Annoying though. It's always been the case with games which is what I'm probably using as a reference. If I slack of, I don't do very well, but if I do put the effort in, I'm really up there "though less and less as I got older". In the arena of programming, I think i'll give it a shot again and just nerd it out or put in a lot more hours, rather than think it can be done another day.
