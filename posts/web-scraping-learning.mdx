description: NextJS is awesome but I wanted to learn something for the backend. Web scrapping seemed interested so I'm going to give that a go.

I've been pretty happy with how this website has been developed. One thing I wasn't so happy with when creating this site was the issues I had as soon as I had to work with Node and that's something I'd like to get sorted. 

## Web Scraping

My interest came whenever I wanted to build a bot that could automatically bet. I know there's a lot of bots which already do this but I have some interest with a specific market and betting company which these bots don't support. I couldn't find an API for the websites I want to get information from and I'm going to need to make a bot anyway. My only exposure to a bot was whenever Adrien of LoL-Academy, would scrap a website to get the MMR of a player. This has always stuck in my mind so I'm interested to learn more about web scraping.

## How I'm going about this

There's a lot to learn with web scraping. The scraping itself doesn't seem so hard but there's a lot of systems that one has to make before it's actually useful.

* Grab the data
* Mutate the data
* Save the data
* Use the data

That's without thinking about managing the bot. There's a lot to learn and cover and I'll more than likely be learning more about the following;

* Node
* FS
* Databases

While I'm probably going to learn a lot more than just that, learning these three things has been a heavy interest of mine for a while and web scrapping allows me to at least crash course myself into these subjects and that excites me.

This is probably going to take a long time to make so I'll update the website as I get to a stage worth talking about!
