One of the weaknesses I have is to lose interest in a project if it takes too long. Okay maybe it's not that bad but it's hard to keep up with projects and ideas when you have so much going on. I wanted to keep working on Codewars and it was a huge motivation as it's hard to keep thinking of the logical puzzles all the time, and it's something I should certainly go back and work on in the future. 

I'm currently on the sofa in my living room, Franky Wah on the background with his latest set, after watching some anime and I decided, it was time to get back to my old coding ways last year, and code when I feel like it. It's nice just to be able to code whenever you want, and spam the text like I am now. 

### Current progress?

So we've got the worker basically working well. It was a bit annoying to get sorted, some problems occured which I'll talk about briefly but thankfully, everything worked without having to look at different libraries. There's no doubt, planning makes things faster and so for the next thing I'll make, I'll certainly do much better in the planning, so it becomes easier to figure out the best way to code something. I really should do it now but I've already kind of started so I'm just going to keep working in iteration and figure it out as it goes along. Planning for success is certainly the way in my opinion. 

The worker works pretty well. We can go from a single link to getting the video set as a mp3, to getting the transcription and lastly, to use ChatGPT to analyse the text. I'm hoping to deploy one of Meta's LLMs as it'll be cheaper in the long term to use it but for now, ChatGPT4 is going to be used. When it starts to get too expensive to use this, I'll have to move on asap. For now, it's for testing purposes. 

#### I've been very surprised

Originally I wanted this to just check the facts and to be honest, coming to think about it, this would have been a very boring app. For some reason though, I started thinking of what would be a good prompt to build out of and I figured something pretty good, thanks to ChatGPT. It feels a little more organic as a result and I'm very happy with how it's come as a result. 

#### What to do now?

The next thing I'm going to do which is very new to me, is get the RabbitMQ server working properly so communication between all the parties work seamlessly. I think this will be the hardest part. I haven't done this before so I'll do something simple without trying to do something too complicated. This feels like the best idea.
