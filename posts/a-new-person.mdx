description: I've becoming a different person, which is the first time in many of many of years. It's weird
---

While I listen to my favourite track, Myon - Cold Summer, a tune I've listened to since I believe January 2021, I'm starting to realise how much of a different person I'm becoming. Since dropping the whole esports stuff, I've started to move my interest away from it. Where being good at games was a priority, it's not anymore. The yearning to be great at it, superceded by the need to do better at other things. I'm not too sure what to think of it. 

### Why does gaming matter?

In some capacity, I'm still a gamer and I don't think that's going to change. I know though I'm one of those people that plays a game to their style. The issue with me and everything it seems, is that as soon as I start to slack of, it becomes harder to maintain it. That's why with programming, I've kept at it constantly. I've kept exposed so my brain has no chance to look away. 

Gaming used to be my life. To play games at the highest level or to manange it as high as was made possible. Recently, the whole thing of esports sickened me. I know why. I believed in the wee guy having a chance to becominig the best. It's how some of the players I operated with, got to that point. I was willing to give them a chance. I got sickened by the whole scene and had to leave. It was all about the money and not the passion of it. You could just tell that it was money first, game second and it's not how I operated. I played to become the best, everything else second and it's how I still maintain the ideals. 

With esports/gaming being my life, I had plenty of time to put time into games. Being good actually mattered and I wanted to be good. It's not really the case with programing and while one should be able to seperate life and work, I find it that I don't have enough time. It might be temporary. I hope it is. I do like playing games at a high level but in the same time, I do enjoy making things but as my friends say, your work shouldn't be your life. I'm complexed by that. 

### You life shouldn't be your work. Doesn't that depend?

I think this depends. I find it that if I don't have something else like gaming, then it's all about the work, but why is that a problem. I enjoy making things. People wouldn't say that to a carpenter. I like to build things but even I in the side of my mind now, says I need to have something else. For someone that wants to go around the world and experience the world, while having a laptop capable of playing games, you'd at least hope that the person was good at games, but do I have enough time?

I think that's the problem. I want to build things. Programming has given me that chance. Before writing this, I decided I wanted to go to Thailand for January. I'm using Skyscanner Plus to do that for me now. I'm just wondering though, what am I going to do there. I always pictured myself coding and gaming, but as someone that's not great at games, I just don't enjoy it as much as a result. 

### So what's the craic?

I'm not sure. This is a developer blog for myself but I think it matters to write stuff like this. I want to become a hell of a developer and I've learnt Nest for an interview. It's great to learn new technologies to build with but the thing I need to do for myself, is learn more about myself. I listened to a podcast there randomly stating that traveling solo helps with discovering yourself. The one thing I know for a certainity, is I love dancing and I want to get better at that. That's just something that's not left me for the years I've kept to it. Maybe that'll be my new thing in the future. Who knows. 

### What's the future to hold?

For myself, I think I want to work on Skyscanner Plus for a good while. I want to build something which allows me to find the sun when I want. I know it'll find me something cheaper than what any other app can do and I'm happy for that. It's just weird that gaming isn't part of what I'm good at anymore. I know at one point I was amazing at CoD1, good enough at PUBG/LOL in the gaming house and now, eh now good. It's just weird. Since I was 12, I've been gaming at the a capacity that just went for it. No fucks given but now, with other things in life matter, I just find it sad I can't be at that level anymore. Oh well. I'll have a dance at Bettys Blacks in a bit.
