There are still things to get sorted and there will be expansions to the Productsbolt API, but I believe the core utility of Productsbolt is ready. The idea, now reality in the form of an API, where if you want to know the cheapest price for a certain product in a line of many shops, is available. With a system like Productsbolt, there's lot of questions that are still to be answered and they can still be within the dev and staging platforms, but I think think it's time to execute a production setup, where the utmost of care is taken into account. I'm actually happier not having this artifically marketed, and I want to talk about that either in this post or the next few in the future.

### Sureal. It's actually acceptably ready

I have a different kind of standards and I think that comes from trying to make a lot of projects. Skyscanner Plus (Exporer Plus), Factsbolt, Jobbolts and now Productsbolt. Beforehand, it was just to make it work for me and honestly, Productsbolt was exactly that. To get it working just for me so I can find the cheapest site to find the product of interest. Personally, it's a good way to go about making the project possible. It's organic and it does what it says but there's a lot more that goes into it. To make it sustainable and that's one of the things I lacked in for years.

### Making the leap

Having an idea which is organic is certainly the first part. It gets you to this part where you have to go and say, right it needs to get to production. With Skyscanner Plus, it was mostly for me but it was able to be used as a website. I remember using it to get to Croatia and that was fun. Unfortunately it wasn't good enough to stand on it's two feet and after situations that came upon the project, I had to end it. Jobsbolt is probably more mature than Productsbolt. I have everything basically ready for it but the ideas I had, I don't think is as good as what I wanted to execute it for. As said, I will work on the project again, test out a few things and figure, is there a way to get the project to a place I would organically want to use.

Productsbolt could be even more refined and the motivations to use it, be as organic as possible. I'll figure out more and more ways to filter out pages that shouldn't be in x, y, z and remove candidatePages automatically that shouldn't be using resources any longer. There's a point I've reached though, which allows me to go "this is actually good enough, the gains are so marginal, you're allowed to move forward" and I think Productsbolt is at that point. It's at the point of needing to have a production lifecycle and it's one I'm going to have to leap into again.

I have a vague idea of how to make this operation work. I have ideas which I'll need to implement to make it easier for the user to operate with to the best extent. This will all take time for a solo developer trying to learn properly, organically, to build something as organic as possible to organically attract people.

### Do I eat organic food only?

I've talked about organic a lot. It's important. It leads to real things happening rather than just making it happening and hope it works. Yes it might end up working for some people, but I think when it's real and done organically, then it's bound to work. I'm bound to learn skills, bound to have a good website/project, bound to bring people to the website on the merit of the service itself. That's what I see from the term organic.

If I'm not really into my project, then I'm not going to put as much effort into it and while others can write a fantastic story where they aren't actually interested in, but have the skills to produce it, and make something of it, I don't take inspiration from that sort of thought. I like to think because it's organic, my name is on the tin, I owe it to make sure it's something I'd be happy to talk about. With sort of mindset and self imposed standard, I'd like to think things go the right way for the correct reasons.

### The next step for Productsbolt

I'm fairly sure Productsbolt in the capacity niche I want to work in, identifies the product on the website correctly while doing an array of other functionality. If problems arise, it'll be taken care of. As I even write now, I question if the product is good enough and on my laptop, no it's not. I'll write in my next post how I'll have to use LM Studio for my laptop while on my PC, vLLM will be used. Productsbolt does do the job I want and the measuring stick I've been using to benchmark against, Google, seems to stand. After 5 mins of search with each product on Google, I was not able to find a cheaper product on it. I might be able to find it for the same price, but because of the way it showcases it's listings, this is made harder. Therefore Productsbolt will find anything Google has to offer, but in an interface which is quicker to navigate. That or Google can't find it at all and it's logically just the better site to use.

To answer the question, it's time to go to production, and thus I have to do a few things.

- Business Plan
- SEO Strategy

I build out the business plan already which didn't take long. It's not a long one but it's a napkin level one but it states what Productsbolt is, what it aims to do, how it operates, why it's etc etc. I have a 90 day plan on what to do next for Productsbolt though that's variable. Same time I think I can hit it but I do want to look up React and Nextjs again. It's a fantastic time to do that when building the website.

I'm going to do a product-led SEO strategy. While others would go with keyword driven, as said above, I want this to be as organic as possible so product-led would force the onus of making sure the best product is thought of. That forces me understand what would make this as good for me, for the customer, for anyone and to craft it in a way which meets SEO methodology. It's like a shop selling coffee to the customer. How you best do that, makes or breaks you. I think if you go from it at a keyword perspective first, your chasing something for numbers and the sake of marketing, whenever SEO should be about proving yourself in the sense of the business, rather than a simple qualification. After the bulk of the product-led SEO is done, then I'll rotate back and ask, using keyword reseach, are there things I want my business to be assiocated with via these keywords and use it for ideas.

SEO for me, is about proving to a search engine why you are the best choice and the Search Engine determining your website/service/thing is the best thing it can offer to it's users. It's enjoyable to operate in this manner.

There might be a bit of PPC to test how users interact with the site. Will a user realise that by clicking on a link or search a term, they'll find the cheapest of X and when they find it, will they go to said shop the list has shown? I'll use PPC as a means to test how people interact and benchmark from there.

### Production

At the start, I'm going to make mistakes and I'm going to have to write out how I want to host/orchestrate this project. While I originally wanted to move this project to be serverless, this is not the case now and it'll be more of a K8 setup which I need to get my head around again. Whenever I have a system which I'm happy with which will operate with said systen, then I'll be cooking with gas. This is the sort of stuff that'll take time to figure out.

As said, I'll build a website which will allow the endpoints to be used outside of postman. An MCP will be added to the API so chatbots can communicate. I really need to make sure my API is secure so that'll be looked at.

This is all going to take time and if I'm to be honest, it makes me nervous. It's a bit more grand than just building for myself. I understand some people might go hmm, this isn't much but it kinda is because when some people make a SaaS which leverages on AI atm, it's very much here's something, do something, goodbye. It's not longterm and the user is in and out. This is going to be longterm and as a result, I need to plan for it while making sure the goals I set out in my business plan and to myself, is adhered to.

For the start, it'll be making sure the production setup works the same way it does as it is now, but online. I'll have to make as setup which leverages on either Openrouter or the local setup. Personally, I'll always want this to be operational of local hardware purely because of cost reasons.

### Conclusion

After walking around today, partly writing this in the morning and then the rest after walking around Bergen. The reindeer hotdog was different and the hot cocoa (I would usually call it a hot chocolate but I've been corrected) might have helped to figure out how to write the rest. Productsbolt is in a good place and while the challenge is to get it at a good place at production standard, instead of think oh woe is me, I might as well just go for it. End of the day, I have something that allows me to figure out when something is at a good price and in stock. Hopefully I can share that with you in the future.
