It didn't even take 24 hours to figure out what to do next but we got here! Not bad. I was thinking of doing more and more work to the site here, and I think I will get to that eventually. To be quick, I'll state what i'm going to do.

### Casual Category

I want to express myself more outside of the confines of development or in general, being a developer. I like building stuff and I'll talk about that more as I go along, jotting down the issues i've had with projects and thinks I'm going through. Thinking about it now, I talk to myself a lot whenever I've got logical issues, so this place will certainly be a great place for those sort of things.

Casual won't be included in the general blog. It'll be it's own category and viewable in the blog. Why is this? I'm going to talk about anything there. As said, while one can use social media to express themselves there, I feel it's annoying to get to know people using that medium. I just want to have a place which is really quick to figure out who I am and my thoughts and given the design of the blog section, thankfully one can just scroll and figure that out fast. Headlines and subtitles give the user, including the images, should allow one to understand what I wish to convey to people and I think that's solid.

### Productsbolt

I'm going to make a website using Nextjs. All the endpoints are available and the site is purely local right now so I have no reason to worry about authentication. If I ever do, then I'll need to worry about users anyway, which would be another subject, so making a local website is the play for now and it'll get me back to making websites. Looking at this site, I'm very happy how I was smart enough once to do awesome component stuff and I'll get back to that. The more I mess around with this site, the more I'll get back to the right mindset.

#### Website

I haven't thought of what the website should do yet, but it should be easy for one to put in a product, then all shops that are added to Productsbolt to find links on their sitemap (list of links) to find pages related to that site. If not, then it simply doesn't. One should be able to after some time, click the product from a list, see the cheapest price and the status of that product in relation to the shop in question. From there, if they wish to buy, well that's their game.

#### Automatic Shop Adding

At the moment, I have to go to a website, find the sitemap and then figure if it's a shopify site and other things. There isn't much thinking and an LLM is probably capable of doing this. This is only really required if I want to add basically every shop and then categories them for what they sell and what they do. It's quite a bit endeavour so I'm not too sure if I want to do this, but I should be able to essentially give a siteUrl at least and then for a bot to do something. n8n or that Openai thing might be a good idea for something like this. I'm not sure I'll get back to this whenever I'm having a cup of tea.

### Jobsbolt

I haven't thought much about this since yesterday. I should have something that simply helps to figure out what is a good job to look for. The coverletter thing where it generates it automatically, I don't think is going to work longterm. Then again, the idea that it figures out how you write and then makes sure you write the stuff from your CV and yourself, that fits the job, is a good idea. What I wanted to do with it, was make sure that one can write what they thought of the company, why they thought they were a good fit for the company, rather than making sure they were tick boxing and not forgetting to say the write things.

Maybe it should be more of a scanner. That seems a lot better. I'm a big believer that with patience and slow progress, good things come. This comes from my time working out in my garage gym (I got my 100kg bench press gg) where one can get annoyed of not progressing fast enough, which to be honest always happens anyway. It's when you return anyway and to keep up with the "grind" and I think this relates back to Jobsbolt with the Cover letter section. I think we should write the cover letter how well we can, taking our time, while Jobsbolt makes sure we've chosen a good job based upon our CV and information we've given to it. Yes a user can lie, but what's the point? The user then writes the cover letter and goes from there. The issue is, if you write a cover letter that's not good enough or misses out on things that matter, you're less likely to be selected for shortlisting. Initially the motivation of the cover letter generator was for the user to just express themselves as said earlier, but it never felt genuine even with all the prompt enginnering I did.

If one is just going to write anyway, you could just put in the CV and job description in an LLM, including the cover letter, and you'll be told what's missing. There's certainly something that can be done here.

There's a future for Jobsbolt and changes need to be done to make it the thing I want it to be for myself and others.

#### Local LLM use

While frontier models are getting smarter and smarter, I absolutely love the idea of making things as cheap as possible, while getting the outcome I want. Funny enough, the idea of keeping my computer on all the time annoys me, but this just means I need a way to get electricity at a capacity which is extremely cheap, so solar panels are going to have to be a thing. I'm probably over thinking this part, but it makes sense to me.

### Final words

So I think I'm confident enough to start on building websites again. I don't want to touch this website too much, it's a bit of a mess and it's using the older version of Nextjs. I like the older version but I assume there's advantages with using the App Router, so I'll have to look into the App Router more.

It's occured to me that the stack I use, is not serverless friendly and it's also something I have to look into in the future. I'll probably talk about AWS CDK tomorrow, that was annoying but in all honesty, was a good real look at what I should have been doing with AWS.
