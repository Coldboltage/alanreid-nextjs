  skills: [
    { end: "Frontend", stack: "Javascript, React, Next" },
    { end: "Backend", stack: "Node, Express, Puppeteer" },
    { end: "Testing", stack: "JEST" },
  ],
  conclusion: "Skyscanner Plus helped me learn more about Puppeteer and how to manage bots as effectively as possible, while learning the issues of bot detection, therefore learning the means to evade such detection practises. While I learnt a lot with Next in this project, managing a database of this size was daunting but I have it in a controllable state.",
  next: "The biggest issue of Skyscanner Plus will be scalability. I aim to learn more about AWS, Kuberneatures and how to handle mutliple clusters with CRON jobs in the same time."
